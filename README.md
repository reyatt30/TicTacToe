About: This Python script implements a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. 
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 

Dependency: This script does not require any external libraries. It uses only the standard Python library.

Follow the Prompts:
- The game will display the current board state.
- Players will be prompted to enter their moves (row and column numbers).
- The game will continue until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
